# CSC 491/492 Senior Project
For my senior project I am creating a web application for a start up company. 
I will be completing this project throughout the winter and spring quarters of 2020.

# Abstract
Three years ago my mother set out to create an after school robotics program for her middle school students.  Since its inception, the program has fostered a positive learning environment where students learn how to engineer and interact with robots while learning the value of teamwork and competing at the highest level.  In order to make the program accessible to the public and offer the team a centralized location to access resources, I set out to create debestrobotics.com.  This website will be used mostly by students enrolled in the program and the instructors.

The main goal of the website is to optimize usability for both the students and the teachers.  In order to achieve this goal, I first started creating and testing the NodeJS backend server until all requirements laid out in the system design were met.  Then I developed the client-side application on top of the server using React and Bootstrap.  Lastly, user demos were conducted at the end of the development to validate the intended outcome of the project.  The feedback from these tests is directly reflected in the final application. 

## Implementation
This web application was built using NodeJS, React, Bootstrap, Redux, and MySQL.  NodeJS was used for back end development along with a MySQL database.  The front end application was created with React, Redux, and Bootstrap using dynamic web development tools.  I started the design process by creating wireframes in figma and writing an API test suite in Postman as I implemented different components.  Creating a fully functional and easy to use website was the main goal of the application.  A payment gateway was originally planned but could not be completed on time.  This is a possible update for later versions of the website.


## Testing and Validation
Testing the API was done through Postman.  The tests were created and run as certain components were added to the application.  The API test suite can be found on the github repo as a .json file. It covers all requirements laid out in functional and user interaction requirements and REST Specification Document.

Once the application became functional on the front and back end, I was able to conduct user demos to determine usability and receive feedback on the website.  The results and feedback from the demos were used to modify and reorganize certain components of the website.  Most of the feedback from these demos included things such as layout issues or small bugs on the client side.  At the end of each test I asked the user to reflect on the overall usability of the website and provide suggestions for improvement.
